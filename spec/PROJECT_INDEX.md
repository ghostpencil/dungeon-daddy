# Dungeon Daddy — Project Index

## Phase

Phase **50 — Hybrid Action Model: COMPLETE & merged to `main`** (2026-06-23).
Phase **50.5 — Use Noun on Noun: COMPLETE** (2026-06-24). Branch: `phase-50.5`. PR pending.
All 9 slices + post-playtest fixes + map level-refresh fix. Suite: 3037+ green.

Specs: current/future phases in `spec/IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES_33_ONWARDS.md` (index:
`spec/IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES.md`). Phase 50.5 spec: `spec/PHASE_50_5_USE_ON_GRAMMAR.md`.

## START HERE next session — open the Phase 50.5 PR, then Phase 51

Branch `phase-50.5` is ready. Open the PR against `main`. Key deliverables for the PR description:
- Grammar: `Verb · Noun · [Target] · Adverb`; `TRANSITIVE_VERBS`; `validate_card` target rules
- `contested` flag on `ObjectTransition` + migration `013`; `CombineItems` + migration `014`
- `GiveItem` validator; `activate` wired (deterministic → `ActivateObject`, contested → roll)
- `look` verb (read-only); Target dropdown in `VnaActionPanel`
- Post-playtest: locked-exit target source, key-unlock persists, fuse consumed on lift power-up
- Map level-refresh fix: level transitions call `map.load()` (repaints new level layout)
- LLM narration hook after `ActivateObject`; Level 2 seed (`tools/populate_crucible_level2.py`)

After merging: **Phase 51 — Talk to the Dungeon** (roadmap). Write `spec/PHASE_51_*.md` when starting.

## Product Direction

> Dungeon Daddy controls the world, dungeon, monsters, NPCs, secrets, clocks,
> consequences, and narration. The human player controls the player side: one or more
> player-controlled actors and the actions they attempt.

**Core authority rule:** The RPG engine and memory layer are authoritative. The LLM is
advisory. It may narrate, frame choices, interpret tone, and propose structured world
reactions. It must not directly mutate authoritative state.

---

## Known Failures

**None.** Full unit/integration suite green. The previously-flaky generator eval is resolved
(`26e95a3`, 2026-06-23): evals are excluded from the default run (`addopts = "-m 'not eval'"` —
run with `pytest -m eval`), and `test_generator_level_passes_validation` now mirrors production's
3-retry regenerate-with-errors budget instead of asserting one-shot validity.

## Phase History

Phases 42 and earlier: `spec/HISTORY.md`. Recent completed phases:

| Phase | Summary | Spec |
|---|---|---|

| 48 — Dungeon Navigation | `RoomExit` model + `room_exits` schema; `MoveParty` command; exit-condition validator; level transitions; `DiscoverExit`/`UnlockExit`/`SealExit`/`BlockExit`; room context bundle; Play-mode exit-list panel + fog-of-war map; party-presence gate on `PickUpItem`/`ActivateObject` | `spec/PHASE_48_DUNGEON_NAVIGATION.md` |

Per-session implementation logs are in git history and the auto-memory (`project_phase_status.md`).

## Notes

- Provider: OpenAI (`gpt-4o`); `OPENAI_API_KEY` must be set.
- Phase specs: current/future in `spec/IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES_33_ONWARDS.md`; index at `spec/IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES.md`. Spec-loading rules and skills: `CLAUDE.md` (canonical).
- Roadmap for Phases 51–53 (planned): GitHub Projects `ghostpencil/dungeon-daddy` #1, mirrored in `IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES_33_ONWARDS.md`. Issue bodies hold per-phase detail; a `spec/PHASE_NN_*.md` is written when each phase starts. (Phase 50.5 is **not** on the roadmap and has no issue.)
- Phase 53 (Threat Behavior & Monster Reactions, planned): engine-bounded monster reactions, no enemy turn; bosses escalate via clock thresholds. Design: `spec/MONSTER_REACTION_DESIGN.md`.
- Evals: `pytest -m eval` (live API, paid, non-deterministic); baseline tooling `python tools/run_evals.py` (count-based comparison).
- Playtest reports: `python -m tools.playtest_report <db_path> <campaign_id>` (requires `PYTHONPATH=.`).
- Exit backfill (pre-Phase-48 campaigns): `python -m tools.backfill_room_exits ["<save dir>"] [--dry-run] [--force]`. Close the app first (DuckDB is single-writer). Saves live under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DungeonDaddy\saves\<name>\`.
- UI icons: `dungeon_daddy/assets/ui/icons/` (white/transparent PNG + SVG source); attribution in `CREDITS.json`. Fetch new ones with the `game-icon-finder` skill.
- `protagonist` actor: `seed_data/campaigns/the-crucible/rpg_seed.json` (use `--seed-pack` + `--force` to reset). Generic `seed_campaign()` no longer creates a placeholder actor.
- Crucible Level 1 content: `tools/populate_crucible_level1.py` (re-run 2026-06-24) — idempotent upserts of 11 objects, 7 loose items, 4 monsters, 1 NPC, and 3 exits into the live save (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\DungeonDaddy\saves\The Crucible\campaign.duckdb`; close app first). Puzzle chain: R1 journal → R2 lift-warden-key → R2→R4 door (key-gated, permanently unlocked on use) → R3 lift-fuse → R4 Great Lift (fuse-gated, consumed on power-up) → Level 2 r01.
- Crucible Level 2 content: `tools/populate_crucible_level2.py` (run 2026-06-24) — Great Lift upper landing in r01 (`state=ready`) + open `r01→R4` vertical connector exit (return to Level 1). Re-run to reset.
- Level-crossing exits: `to_level_id` encodes the **0-based list index** of the target level (not the 1-based level ID used for data scoping). `"level:0"` = Level 1 (index 0), `"level:1"` = Level 2 (index 1). `connector_type` must be set for `apply_move_party` to honour `to_level_id`.
- Example campaign manifest: `examples/campaign_manifests/bone-cathedral.json` (validates + seeds cleanly).
- `proposal.applied` / `proposal.rejected` events: call sites must insert `result.rejection_events` into repo with the correct `campaign_id` after `validate_proposal()`.
